## Ethereum

* [go-ethereum Authors](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/release/1.9/AUTHORS#L316)

Ethereum was initially proposed in 2013 in a white paper by Vitalik Buterin, a cryptocurrency researcher and programmer. In the white paper, Vitalik Buterin described Ethereum as a public, open-source, Blockchain-based computing platform featuring smart contract functionality. Since the release of Ethereum in 2015, several other projects featuring smart contract functionality have emerged, but these platforms are unable to host both private and public smart contracts.

To address these shortcomings, what is needed is an open-source, hybrid, Blockchain-based computing platform: one that features hybrid transactions, hybrid smart contracts, and hybrid decentralized applications.

1. Open & Neutral
2. Borderless & Censorship-resistant
3. Decentralized & Private

### Identity theft & fraud
- These have reached epidemic levels and form one of the fastest-growing types of (cyber-) crime.

### Large scale data breaches
- Lets change the way personal data is being currently stored and shared by allowing individuals to retain full control over it, moving the storage from corporations to individuals and as such safeguarding personal data from data breaches, identity theft, unnecessary duplication and abuse.

### A fully secure and private digital blockchain
- Smilo is the ultimate enterprise ready solution that allow’s individuals to be and remain the sole owner and distributor of its personal data through a fully secure and private blockchain solution.



To address these shortcomings, what is needed is an open-source, hybrid, Blockchain-based computing platform: one that features hybrid transactions, hybrid smart contracts, and hybrid decentralized applications. This is where the Smilo Platform shines.

Smilo network, currently uses the Smilo BFT+ consensus protocol. This consensus algorithm ensures secure, scalable, quick, and sustainable transactions. Additionally, all the transactions will be free of charge enabling corporations to deploy engaging decentralized applications.

Besides, this consensus mechanism also empowers the community with the autonomy to run their own full-nodes. Smilo can achieve complete decentralization with enough independent full-nodes, and through this network of networks the transaction processing capabilities of the platform will be over 3000 transactions per second, increasing with every additional full-nodes.
