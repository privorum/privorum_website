I help companies to identify and make the best use of their key performance indicators, services and Big Data.

With 15 years of work experience on different projects, countries and languages, I'm a specialist in creating, designing, testing and managing high performance APIs and services.

I have influenced decisions and performed work in several roles within the IT industry. From Developer to Director, including Solutions Architect and Technical Tester.

I have been actively building Blockchain core software, currently we are engaged in [Dusk Network](https://dusk.network) [Polkadot Gossamer](https://github.com/ChainSafe/gossamer), [MDL](https://github.com/MDLlife/MDL), [Smilo](https://github.com/smilofoundation/go-smilo) and [ETC](https://ethereumclassic.org/)

You have a Vision. I know the way to get you there.
